# Who I Am  
Hi, I'm **Kayden Weatherford**, a freshman at the **University of Wisconsin–Whitewater**, currently pursuing a **Computer Science degree** (as of 9/2/25).  

I fell in love with Computer Science during my AP courses in high school. I enjoy the challenge of learning new languages, building projects, and seeing ideas come to life through code. My former teacher, **Dr. Daniel Szelogowski**, played a big role in inspiring me to pursue this path.  

At the start of this school year, I’m learning while recovering from a broken shoulder—so it’s been a bit of an adjustment! But I’m still excited and motivated to grow as a developer here at UWW.

# What Is This?  
This repository is a collection of my projects and coursework from my time at UWW. Some projects may be experimental or incomplete, while others will be fully developed. My goal is to use this space as a timeline of my progress and learning journey in Computer Science.  

Feel free to explore, follow along, and see how my skills evolve over the next few years!
